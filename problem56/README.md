# Problem 56: Powerful digit sum

## Problem statement

A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by
one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large:
one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the
digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, *a*<sup>*b*</sup>, where *a*,
*b* < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

## Comments

Looks to be a fairly straightforward use of the bigint library.

yep, it was. I even wrote it on my phone.
