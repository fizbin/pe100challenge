# Problem 6

## Problem Statement

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2+2^2+...+10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Comments

There are straightforward formulas for `\sum_{k=1}^n k^2`, but it's so
simple in this case to use brute force that I won't bother looking
them up.
