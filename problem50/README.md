# Problem 50: Consecutive prime sum

## Problem statement

<p>The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:</p>
<div class="center">41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13</div>
<p>This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.</p>
<p>The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.</p>
<p>Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?</p>

## Comments

Okay, so I guess first I construct the up-to-one-million sieve and then... I'm not sure.
I guess I'll start with the simplest brute force method, and go from there.
