# Problem 10 - Summation of primes

## Problem Statement

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Comments

Well this is certainly a job for a sieve-based approach.

I don't think I'll re-use any code from earlier because I didn't
implement the sieve correctly, really.

...

Well, that worked well. I'm still getting the hang of rust's lambda
expressions.

I also keep slamming into errors where the compiler tells me that I
should dereference something, and I dereference what it suggests, and
it works, but I think I'm missing something about most of these places
where I end up with a reference instead of the value I intend.
