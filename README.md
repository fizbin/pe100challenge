# Project Euler 100 Challenge

[General Information about the Project Euler 100 Challenge][1]

I'm attempting this in rust, which is a language I haven't used before.

For now, each problem is structured in its own rust project, created
with `cargo new`.

Each directory should have in it its own `README.md` file which
contains the problem statement and some notes of mine on the solution
and what rust I'm learning as I do the problem.
