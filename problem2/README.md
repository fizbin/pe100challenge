# Problem 2

## Problem statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Comments

Instead of generating each Fibonacci number, I generated only the even
values. It is well-known that Fibonacci numbers can be generated with:

    \begin{pmatrix}
    F_{n} \\ F_{n-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}^n
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}

(Assuming that F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> are 0 and 1,
respectively)

Since even Fibonacci numbers happen every third term, I generated only
the even terms by taking that matrix to the third power and starting
with `fibn = 2` and `fibnm1 = 1`.

This could possibly also be done by hand since there are formulas for
the sum of the first _n_ Fibonacci numbers which could be adapted to
the first _n_ even Fibonacci, but that's for some other time.
