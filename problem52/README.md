# Problem 52: Permuted multiples

## Problem statement

It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same
digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

## Comments

Obviously, x is a multiple of nine and begins with between 10... and 17....

I guess from that we can find it, just with brute force searching.

Yep, pretty straightforward brute-forcing takes less than 0.01s on the Raspberry pi.
